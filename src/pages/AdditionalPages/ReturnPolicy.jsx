        <p>

At Shopease, we strive to ensure your satisfaction with every purchase. If you are not entirely satisfied with your order, we offer a straightforward return policy to make the process as smooth as possible. Please read our return policy carefully before initiating a return:
<br /><br />
1. Eligibility for Returns
   - To be eligible for a return, the product must be unused, in its original packaging, and in the same condition as when you received it. Certain products, such as perishable goods, intimate or sanitary items, and gift cards, may not be eligible for return. Please check the product description or contact our customer support for specific eligibility information.
<br /><br />
2. Return Process
   - To initiate a return, please follow these steps:
     a. Contact our customer support within 15 days of receiving the product to notify us of your intention to return.
     b. Provide your order details, including the order number, product(s) being returned, and reason for the return.
     c. Our customer support team will guide you through the return process and provide you with a return authorization if applicable.
     d. Package the product securely, including all original accessories, manuals, and any promotional items that came with it.
     e. Ship the product back to the designated return address provided by our customer support. You will be responsible for the return shipping costs, unless the return is due to our error or a defective product.
     <br /><br />
3. Refunds
   - Once the returned product is received and inspected, we will notify you of the status of your refund. If the return is approved, a refund will be initiated to your original payment method within a reasonable timeframe. Please note that the refund amount may be subject to deductions for shipping fees or restocking charges, if applicable.
   <br /><br />
4. Damaged or Defective Products
   - If you receive a damaged or defective product, please contact our customer support immediately. Provide detailed information and, if possible, include supporting evidence such as photos. We will guide you through the return process and arrange for a replacement or refund, depending on product availability and your preference.
   <br /><br />
5. Exchanges
   - We currently do not offer direct product exchanges. If you wish to exchange a product, please follow the return process outlined above and place a new order for the desired item.
   <br /><br />
6. Return Exceptions
   - Some products may have specific return conditions, warranty policies, or manufacturer's guidelines that override our general return policy. In such cases, we will provide you with the relevant information and guide you accordingly.
   <br /><br />
7. Contact Us
   - If you have any questions or need further assistance regarding our return policy, please contact our customer support team. We are here to help you through the process and address any concerns you may have.
   <br /><br />
Please note that this return policy is subject to change at our discretion. It is recommended to review the policy periodically for any updates.
